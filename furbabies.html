            weeks old as of October 1st, 2018 and ready for his forever home.
            Babba likes to take lots of naps during the day so that he is fully
            charged up for his 3 a.m. rodeo sessions where he bounces off every
            vertical surface he encounters and skids across the horizontal
            spaces in between. He is extremely fond of chin scratches, clean
            laundry, and sunny windowsills. Babba is also fearless when it comes
            to dogos, and hasn't met one yet he didn't treat like his long lost
            best friend. </td>

          <td>This is CrustyGurl and she's approximately 10 weeks old as of
            September 1st, 2018. Crusty is a lover of the great outdoors and
            doesn't do well with staying inside. She is all a big fan of dirt,
            dust, muck, and anything that gets her paws messy. However, she
            cleans up well and will spend several hours washing after the
            sundown. Crusty doesn't like to eat wet food, and she prefers to
            sleep alone even though she is a lap cat. She also likes to watch
            over sleeping babies and has been known to come get you when they
            get fussy.</td>

          </td>
          <td>This is TomTom, and he's nearly full grown. We estimate he is
            between 1 and 2 years old, but we're not entirely sure. TomTom is
            Mr. Mellow, and seldom goes faster than a slow stroll--even when
            he's hungry and it's dinner time. He likes cuddles and back
            scratches, and has been known to fall asleep with his tongue
            sticking out from too much purring. TomTom is also a natural born
            kitten sitter, and will watch over little ones like they are his
            own. He never gets impatient with the small fur babies, no matter
            how much they chew on his tail or try to play wrestling match. Tom
            is also a proud member of the empty dish club, and will never let
            any food go to waste.<br>

          </td>
          <td>This is Miss Lily and she came to us from a local animal clinic.
            Her owner was an elderly woman who passed away while Lily was
            getting a boo boo stitched up. The vet wasn't able to find her a new
            home when nobody came to claim her, so we made an exception to our
            kittens-only rule. Miss Lily must sleep on her own pillow and does
            not like to get her paws dirty. She primps and preens about 15 hours
            a day. According to the vet, Lily is approximately 3 years old as of
            August 2018. She gets along well with other cats and dogs, as long
            they don't slobber on her. Miss Lily is not too fond of CrustyGurl
            though, because she is just not down with that the down-n-dirty
            crowd. She is also a very sneaky milk thief, and is known to get her
            head stuck in tall glasses when she steals a few lickety licks.<br>
