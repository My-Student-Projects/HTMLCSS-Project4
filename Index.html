      <h1>Welcome to the Central PA Kitty Rescue!</h1>
      <h2> Why is this necessary?</h2>
      <p> As anyone who has visited the local Humane Society or volunteered with
        PAWS knows, the greater Harrisburg has a stray cat problem. There are
        over nine thriving colonies of stray cats from Steelton to Middletown
        alone, most of which have been around for the past twenty years.
        Unfortunately, this is because unlike larger urban areas we lack no-kill
        shelters and the Humane Society has been at maximum capacity since the
        early 1990s. </p>
      <h2>What is a kitty rescue?</h2>
      <p> We are basically three lonely cat ladies with big empty houses. We
        started the Central PA Kitty Rescue when we all became empty-nesters in
        2008. We all volunteered with PAWS to assist with our local catch and
        release drives to keep the kitties neutered. We also found homes for the
        friendlier strays wherever we could place them. But there came a point
        where the baby kittens just broke our hearts, so we decided to start our
        own mini network of no-kill fostering shelters. The kittens we accept
        are raised indoors with other animals, litter trained, kept clean and
        well groomed, and have been taught some modicum of good manners with
        varying degrees of success. </p>
      <h2> The details that matter most:</h2>
      <p> We only accept cats less than one year old that have been abandoned or
        born to an existing stray cat population. This is due to the high number
        of homeless felines and our ability to place them with loving families.
        Also, we each have our own full-grown pets and they typically only get
        along well with the little kittens. Our homes have all been approved by
        the Adopt-a-Pet Network of Pennsylvania, and we work with the Humane
        Society, a variety of pet clinics, and several municipalities. </p>
